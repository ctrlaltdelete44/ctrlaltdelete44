### Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

*He/Him, Developer @plymouthsoftware*
I'm a part-time developer, part-time student (third year Computer Science at Plymouth Uni). I work primarily with Ruby on Rails, and have written a few articles on using Ruby on Rails with Docker - check them out on my [website](www.delete44.com)...

Beyond this I'm a total music nerd & collect playing cards 😁♣️
