### Hi, I'm Anthony 👋

*He/Him, Developer [@plymouthsoftware](https://www.plymouthsoftware.com)*

I'm a part-time developer, full-time student (third year Computer Science at Plymouth Uni). I work primarily with Ruby on Rails, & have written a few articles on using Ruby on Rails with the reactive frontend framework Vue - check them out on my [website](https://www.delete44.com)...

I'm trying to learn as much as I can about accessibility on the web & incorporate that into projects I work on. If you have any advice, let me know!

Beyond this I'm a total music nerd & collect playing cards 😁♣️
